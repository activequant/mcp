      <p>
       Velocity has a number of external jar dependencies. However, not all of these
       are needed every time. This document should help you do decide which jars must
       also be present if you want to integrate Velocity into your application.
      </p>

      <p>
       All of these jars must be present when building Apache Velocity. The build process
       downloads all of them automatically from the Internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most common case is the integration of the Velocity runtime into your
        application. In this case, you must add commons-collections and commons-lang
        to your application (and optional Oro or commons-logging if
        required). If you already have one or more of these libraries in your application,
        you should check if you need to update their versions.
      </p>

      <p>The <a href="dependencies.html">auto-generated dependency report</a> lists all mandatory
         dependencies as <b>compile</b> and all optional dependencies as <b>provided</b>, though
         it fails to properly reflect the optional nature of the Oro and Commons-Logging dependencies.
