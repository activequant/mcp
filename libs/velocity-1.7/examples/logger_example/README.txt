logger_example
--------------

This 'toy' example shows how to use the Velocity logger interface
to have any class function as a logging facility.  

To run :

./logger_example.sh

or 

logger_example.bat


Log4jLoggerExample
------------------
This class demonstrates how to configure Velocity to use an 
 existing log4j logger for logging.

To test this example, change "LoggerExample" to "Log4jLoggerExample"
in the batch file and run.

You will see that the log4j output will contain the output from
velocity's initialization.
